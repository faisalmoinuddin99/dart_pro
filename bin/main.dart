// Exploring Data Types and Variables
/*
* Dart has special support for these data types
* 1. Numbers: int, double
* 2. Strings
* 3. Booleans
* 4. List (also known as Arrays)
* 5. Maps
* 6. Runes (for expressing Unicode characters in String)
* 7. Symbols
*
* --> NOTE: All data types in Dart are Objects
*           Therefore, values are by default 'null'
